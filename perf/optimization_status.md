## Tuning conclusions

### Long-context decode: **use `paged_attention_v2`**, not v1 or staged
`paged_attention_v2` is ~2.2× faster than the v1 single-threadgroup decode at ctx=2048 and the
gap widens with context, because it exposes the KV-sequence partitions as an extra grid axis
(`grid.z = num_partitions`) — far more threadgroups in flight than v1's `num_heads × batch`.

### GQA KV-reuse staging (item 6): **measured slower on Apple — keep v1/v2 as default**
`paged_attention_gqa_staged` is **1.7× slower** than plain `paged_attention` on MLX (1.08× on
torch-MPS) despite staging each KV vector once and reusing it across the group. Two Apple-specific
reasons: (1) it collapses the grid from `num_heads × batch` to `num_kv_heads × batch` threadgroups,
cutting the parallelism the GPU needs to hide memory latency; (2) the per-token `threadgroup_barrier`
pair serializes the group's simdgroups. The bandwidth saved (group_size× fewer KV reads) does not
recover that on this hardware — the caches are small enough that occupancy, not KV bandwidth, is the
bottleneck at decode batch sizes. This mirrors the earlier `gemm_staged.metal` finding that bigger
multi-warp tiles were slower on Apple. **The kernel is kept** (bit-equivalent, selectable) for
hardware/shapes where KV bandwidth dominates, but it is not the default.

### MoE grouped GEMM (item 2): one segmented launch replaces the per-expert host loop
`moe_grouped_gemm` runs all experts in a single dispatch (32×32 tiles, `expert_of_tile` lookup),
avoiding E separate encoder round-trips. It scales with total padded rows × H, as expected.

## Open items
- Sweep `paged_attention_v2` `partition_size` (256 used here) per context length.
- Benchmark the fp8 KV read paths (`paged_attention_fp8`, `paged_attention_v2_fp8`) vs the fp
  caches to quantify the dequant-on-read cost.
- MoE grouped GEMM vs the retained per-expert-dispatch fallback at small E / few rows per expert.
